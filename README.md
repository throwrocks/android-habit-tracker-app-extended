# android-habit-tracker-app
Android app to keep track of the frequency of your habits.

I developed this app as part of the Udacity Android training. The app implemented a SQLite database and ContentProvider to manage the creation and updating of habits. To create a habit touch the lower FAB button and type in the habit name. Every day that you complete the habit you touch the "+" button next to it to increase its count. The app will calculate a % based on the times you have completed this habit since the day you added it.
